# Summarize-News-Article

This News Summarizer project is a Python GUI application that allows users to enter a news article URL. It automatically fetches the article, extracts the title, author, publish date, and summary using the newspaper3k library, and performs sentiment analysis using TextBlob to determine if the article is positive, negative, or neutral. The results are displayed in a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
